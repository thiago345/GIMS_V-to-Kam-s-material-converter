# GIMS Evo with GTAV support materal to Kam's material converter
A 3ds Max's maxscript that converts GIMS V material to Kam's material for total convesions.

I've worked on a script that converts GTAV materials to Kam's maxscript material for GTA III, GTA VC and GTA SA. You should have Kam's maxscript installed.

This script basically takes the name of the of the GIMS V material specially **EGIMS_V_Material** and creates a **GTA_Mtl** of Kam's Max Scripts and cop√Ω the name of the GTAV's material model and creates a colormap with a bitmap file with the name of GTAV Material name from GIMS Evo with GTA V support.

It should be sufficient to make mush faster conversions.

## Do not place in scripts/Startup forlder of 3ds Max

A problem maybe caused by loading order the script don't work and max gives an error by undefined function.

## Compatibility:

Tested:

* 3ds max 2016

Should work:


* 3ds max 2017
* 3ds max 2015
* 3ds max 2014
* 3ds max 2013
