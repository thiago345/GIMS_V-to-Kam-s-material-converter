# Rename_Big_Objects_Names.ms - Rename object names

GTA 3D Renderware Era has limits inside .IMG object names for 20 characters, and for .COL (19) for object names, so I created a script taking code examples. This tool renames from beginning of the name preserving the end (the most important since there are object preffix like [region_number_] that are known for .MAX file scene and not needed.

Ex:

**CS4_02_JTNP_SignAwn_LOD003** renamed to **JTNP_SignAwn_LOD003**
